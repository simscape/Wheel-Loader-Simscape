%% Power Split CVT with Four Speed Ranges
% 
% <<sm_cvt_power_split_pg_4range_Overview.png>>
% 
% This example models a power split continuously variable transmission
% (CVT) with four planetary gears and five clutches.
% 
% Two power sources turn mechanical shafts attached to the sun and ring
% gear of the first planetary gear.  The output shaft is attached to the
% carrier of the fourth planetary gear. The output speed of the gearset is
% affected by the two input speeds, the gear ratios of the four planetary
% gears, and the clutches between the third and fourth planetary gear.  Any
% gear ratio can be achieved between the ring gear and the carrier
% (including 0) by varying the speed of the sun gear.
%
% The clutches enable a wider range of ratios (or output speeds) to be
% achieved for a narrower range of sun shaft input speed. Progressively
% higher output/input ratios are achieved by changing the states of the
% clutches.

%% Simulation Results: Full Speed Range Test
%%
%
% This test keeps the speed of the ring shaft constant while the speed of
% the sun gear is varied.  This is the situation for a CVT used with an
% engine that is kept running at a speed close to its maximum efficiency,
% and must always spin to power other implements, such as hydraulic pumps
% or generators that drive other implements on the vehicle. The vehicle,
% however, may come to rest while the engine is running.  
%
% The sun gear speed is varied to show that different vehicle speeds can be
% achieved even while the engine is spinning at a near constant speed.  The
% use of additional planetary gears and clutches enables a wide range of
% output/input ratios for a smaller range of sun shaft speeds.  
%
% The key challenge in the design is that at the moments the clutches
% change state, the CVT output/input ratio must be the same.  This requires
% careful selection of planetary gear ratios, sun/engine speed ratios, and
% speed at which to change the clutches.  To see how to tune CVT design
% parameters to meet the design criteria, see
