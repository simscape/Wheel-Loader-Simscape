%% Extracting Point Cloud from STL Geometry: Wheel
% 
% This example shows MATLAB commands to obtain coordinates for the point
% cloud that is used to detect collision between the wheels and the ground
% terrain. The STL file for the wheel is read into MATLAB, and then a
% few commands are used to extract just the points that are useful for the
% contact and friction force calculation.
%
% The code used in the example is <matlab:edit('mars_rover_terrain_ptcloud_wheel_create.m') mars_rover_terrain_ptcloud_wheel_create.m>.

%% Filter Points Based on Location
%
% As the data is all in x-y-z coordinates, we could look for points on the
% edge of the wheel on the tips of the fins.  With STL files, you sometimes
% need to eliminate duplicate points using the MATLAB command
% <matlab:doc('unique') unique>.  The code below finds points on the wheel 
% edge that are outside a specified radius.

% Obtain unique points
tire_stl_points_unique = unique(tire_stl_points.Points,'Rows');

% STL may not be centered at [0 0 0]
% Obtain center point from CAD import in mm
ctrPt = Wheel_Loader.coordSys(39).transform.translation'*1000;

% Calculate radius for each point in the yz-plane (distance from center)
radPts = vecnorm(tire_stl_points_unique(:,[2 3])-ctrPt(:,[2 3]),2,2);

% Only include points more than 400 mm away from center
rimInds = intersect(find(radPts>400),find(radPts<450));

tread_points = tire_stl_points_unique(rimInds,:);

%% Filter Points Using Convex Hull
%
% Another method which is useful is extracting the points that form a
% convex hull. This is the smallest set of points that completely contains
% the shape, which for our wheel is useful. The resulting set would work
% for modeling contact between the wheel and the ground, but has many more
% points than we need for relatively smooth terrain.  
%
% Obtaining this set of points uses <matlab:doc('delaunayTriangulation')
% delaunayTriangulation> and <matlab:doc('convexHull') convexHull>.

wheel_stl_points_tri = delaunayTriangulation(tire_stl_points_unique);
cvh_inds  = convexHull(wheel_stl_points_tri);

% Use unique to eliminate duplicate references to points
cvh_points = unique(wheel_stl_points_tri.Points(cvh_inds,:),'Rows');

%% Reduced Set of Points using Convex Hull and Location-Based Filtering
%
% Combining these two techniques we can obtain a set of points that is
% sufficient to accurately model contact and permits efficient simulation.

% Calculate radius for each convex hull point in the yz-plane 
radCVHPts = vecnorm(cvh_points(:,[2 3])-ctrPt(:,[2 3]),2,2);

% Only include points more than 400 mm away from center
rimCVHInds = intersect(find(radCVHPts>400),find(radCVHPts<450));
treadCVHpoints = cvh_points(rimCVHInds,:);
