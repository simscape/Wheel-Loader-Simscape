%% Model
%
% This example models a wheel loader linkage.
%
% The actuation model for the linkage and implements can be
% configured to use the following options
%
% * *Ideal*: Cylinder positions are set using prescribed motion.
% Simulation runs very quickly.  Used to determine actuator requirements.
% * *Hydraulic*: Hydraulic pumps, valves, and cylinders are used to
% model the actuation system.  Used to select hydraulic components and set
% pressure levels.

%% Linkage Subsystem
%
% The wheel loader linkage has a lift and tilt actuator.  The implement can
% be configured to be a bucket or a grapple.

%% Bucket Subsystem
%
% The bucket subsystem contains only a model of the bucket.  The interface
% to this mechanical model is composed of three frames.  Two are connection
% points to the linkage and one is the location where the inertial load is
% added to represent the load it digs up and dumps out. The frame that
% interfaces to the load is placed in a Simscape bus.  This is because the
% subsystem interface for all implements must be the same, and other
% implements need more connections than the bucket does.

%% Grapple Subsystem
%
% The grapple subsystem contains the rake and two toothbars. Each toothbar
% can be raised or lowered by an actuator.  The interface to this
% mechanical model is composed of two frames and a bus with connections to
% contact geometry.  The frames are connection points to the linkage. The
% three point clouds are assembled in to a Simscape bus. The point clouds
% are used to detect contact with objects, such as a log, so that the
% grapple can pick them up and move them.

%% Actuator Subsystem: Hydraulic
%
% In this configuration the cylinders are actuated by a hydraulic system.
% Pumps are driven by the PTO shaft, one for the linkage and implements and
% another for the steering system. Valves control the flow of hydraulic
% fluid to the actuators which extend and contract to the desired position.
%
% The steering hydraulic system is included but in this model it is not
% connected to the chassis.
%
% The interface from this 1D model of the hydromechanical system and the 3D
% multibody of the linkage is a 1D mechanical connection for the rod of
% each cylinder.

%% Valves Linkage Subsystem
%
% Directional valves control the flow of fluid to the hydraulic cylinders.
% Flow from the pump can be directed to the head or rod side of the
% cylinder. A pressure relief valve protects the system from providing too
% much pressure to the cylinders.
%
% A flow divider splits the pump flow between the tilt and flow valves.  It
% measures the pressure differential between the two functions and controls
% the flow accordingly. This is used to maintain consistent actuator
% velocity whether one or both functions are active.

%% Actuator Linkage Subsystem
%
% Two hydraulic cylinders lift the wheel loader linkage and a third
% cylinder is used to tilt the implement. The A and B ports are connected
% to the hydraulic network.  The R port represents a 1D mechanical
% connection.  This shaft connections are the interface to the 3D multibody model of the
% wheel loader linkage.

%% Lift Actuator: Shaft
%
% The lift actuator can be modeled as an hydraulic actuator.  In this
% configuration, the interface between the actuator model and the multibody
% joint between the cylinder and the rod is a 1D mechanical connection
% representing a shaft. Force and velocity information is exchanged between
% the 1D and 3D models to ensure consistent kinematic and dynamic behavior.
% This interface is suitable for any actuator model with a mechanical
% connection, including a lead screw or other electrical actuator.

%% Actuator Subsystem: Ideal
%
% In this configuration the cylinders are motion actuated.  The extension
% of the cylinder is prescribed by a time-based profile.  The force
% required to actuate the cylinder is calculated by the simulation.  
%
% The actuator subsystem has no actuation models in it.  It only contains a
% model to apply a countertorque to the power take-off (PTO) shaft that is
% commensurate with the amount of power it takes for the actuators to
% follow the prescribed motion.

%

% and the rod accepts position as an input signal.  The force required to
% follow this trajectory is calculated by the Simscape model.
