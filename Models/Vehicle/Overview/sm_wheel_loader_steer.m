%% Model
%
% This example models a wheel loader steering system.  The chassis rear is
% fixed in place.  As the steering wheel is turned, the orbital valve
% (steering valve) in the hydraulic system directs flow to the steering
% actuator to articulate the chassis.

%% Valve Steer Subsystem
%
% The steering valve contains a directional valve and a metering device (gerotor).
% As the steering wheel is turned, the difference in angle between the
% steering wheel and and the gerotor will open orifices in the directional
% valve.  Fluid will flow from the pressure source through the gerotor
% to the steering cylinder, which articulates the vehicle.  When the
% steering wheel stops turning, the gerotor will rotate until it reaches
% the position where the orifices are closed.  
% 
% This valve lets the steering wheel position specify the steering *cylinder* 
% position.  This is different than other valves in the hydraulic system
% where the *spool* position is set by the input.

%% Valve Steer Orifices Subsystem
%
% This subsystem models the directional valve within the steering valve. It
% is modeled as a custom subsystem using orifices and check valve blocks.

%% Simulation Results: Y Cycle
%%
%
% The plots below show the simulation results of a Y cycle test.  The
% steering system is steered twice to the left during the first half of the
% test, and then twice to the right during the second half of the test.
%
% Note that in the first plot, the articulation angle returns to zero even
% though the steering wheel final angle is non-zero.  This is because the
% connection between the steering wheel and steering cylinder is purely
% hydraulic and we are using a single-sided cylinder.  It takes less fluid
% to turn in one direction than the other as the cylinder chambers have
% different volumes.
