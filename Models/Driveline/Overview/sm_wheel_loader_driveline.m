%% Model
%
% This example models a driveline with an articulation joint.  The
% articulation joint can be configured to be a universal joint or a
% constant velocity joint

%% Simulation Results
%%
%
% The input shaft is rotated at at constant speed.  The bend angle of the
% shaft is increased.  The test with the universal joint shows that the
% speed of the output shaft varies.  The test with the constant velocity
% joint shows that the output speed does not vary.
